# Emmet Is Awesome!

Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors which greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow.

Basically, most text editors out there allow you to store and re-use commonly used code chunks, called “snippets”. While snippets are a good way to boost your productivity, all implementations have common pitfalls: you have to define the snippet first and you can’t extend them in runtime.

Emmet takes the snippets idea to a whole new level: you can type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation. Emmet is developed and optimised for web-developers whose workflow depends on HTML/XML and CSS, but can be used with programming languages too.

Start learning Emmet with the abbreviation syntax and available actions.

It provides you:

- **HTML from CSS:**
  You’ve already known how to use Emmet abbreviations: its syntax is inspired by CSS selectors.  

- **Dynamic snippets:**
  Each abbreviation is transformed in runtime: just slightly change its name to get a different result.

- **Ultra-fast coding:**
  With Emmet you can quickly write a bunch of code, wrap code with new tags, quickly traverse and select important code parts and more!

- **Customizable:**
  Users can easily add new snippets and fine-tune Emmet experience with just a few JSON files.

- **Platform for new tools:**
  Dig into Emmet source code and re-use its modules to create your very own and unique actions.

- **Highly portable:**
  Emmet is written in pure JavaScript and works across different platforms: web browser, Node.js, Microsoft WSH and Mozilla Rhino.
