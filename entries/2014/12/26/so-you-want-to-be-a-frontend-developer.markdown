#So you want to be a frontend developer?

It’s common for people to ask what we look for in a frontend developer, and sometimes, how they can switch careers and learn to code. If you’re one of those people, here are a few tips that might help you understand what we look for as an agency, and how to get started.

##Your personal stack

- **HTML/CSS** - obviously.
- **Sass** - it’s so simple to get to grips with, and you’ll begin to love it. Great frontend development is also about writing well organised, maintainable code.
- You need to be rock solid with responsive design. It’s very easy to learn the basics, anyway.
- **Get great at Javascript** - (learn ‘vanilla’ Javascript before you begin to rely upon jQuery)
- **Learn Git**

In a small team, you’ll often find yourself responsible for integrating design with a CMS or a functional language. The important thing is that you can deal with functional code and edit it when needed, even if you’re not building an entire app from scratch.

We’re not mad—we realise that trying to become a great frontend developer is a discipline in itself, and you can’t be expected to be brilliant at design, frontend and backend all at once. But if we’re working on an intensive project and need to style a modal, for example, then having a designer produce a mockup, a frontend developer code it, and a backend developer implement it, is horribly inefficient and leads to poor quality end-products which take ages to build.

##The way you think

We’re building a *learning organisation*—everybody here is absolutely committed to helping each other get better at what we do. It’s not about competing with other people and agencies—it’s about meeting that endless drive to keep growing, challenging ourselves, and learning more.

- **Don’t bother with a university degree in ‘Web Design’** — personally, I’ve found very few of these that were decent, outside of a few great places like [Hyper Island](https://www.hyperisland.com/) and [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/). The University experience is a really valuable one for a lot of people, for sure, but what you do outside the lecture theatre is way more important. Use that free time to learn as much as you can, and definitely consider doing a non media-related degree, if you do choose to do one.
- Become **obsessed with self-improvement** and learning new skills. There’s nothing worse than being *content* with the skills you have. If you’re a developer who is content and you’re not learning, you’re falling behind. You won’t get anywhere in this industry without being determined to learn new things.

Good luck, and enjoy!
